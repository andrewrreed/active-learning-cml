### How to use Active Learner?

* First, select the appropriate hyperparameters - selection strategy, initial labeled examples, learning rate, and number of epochs
* Click "Train" button to start model training
* When training is completed, a 2D visualization of the embeddings will be rendered. Also, the model performance on the train and validation datasets will be reflected in the corresponding graphs 
* The datapoints that require human labeling are overlaid on the 2D visualization as "to label" dots
* Next, provide labels by clicking on these data points which then renders the image on the right hand side, label and click "Submit"
* Train the model again
* Repeat the process until you have achieved the desired performance

You can also reset the data and training by clicking on the "Reset" button
