Supervised machine learning, while powerful, needs labeled data to be
effective. Active learning reduces the number of labeled examples needed to
train a model, saving time and money while obtaining comparable performance to
models trained with much more data.   
    
This application is meant to serve as a complement to the [prototype](https://activelearner.fastforwardlabs.com/) 
for the report we released on Learning with Limited Labeled Data. To build an 
intuition for why active learning works, please see our blogpost -
